## Project Description
The main research direction of this project is to design and develop a secure platform that allows users to trade platform-specific tokens and use them for buying and selling wines. This project bridges contemporary blockchain technology with traditional wine investing.

## Main Contributions
As the frontend lead, my key contributions include:
- **Requirement Analysis and Architecture Design:** Participated in and contributed to these stages.
- **Frontend Structure Setup:** Set up the overall structure of the frontend.
- **Design and Implementation:** Led the design and implementation of the entire frontend system.
- **System Integration and Testing:** Contributed to the integration and conducted extensive testing for the frontend.

## Achievements
### Creative Integration
- Developed and deployed a cutting-edge platform that integrates blockchain technology with traditional wine investing.
- Enabled tokenization of wine assets, opening new avenues for trade and investment.

### Platform Development
- Created a user-friendly, reliable, and secure interface to facilitate wine investment for users of varying technical skills.
- Ensured platform integrity and functionality through extensive testing methodologies.

### User-Centric Design
- Employed a user-centric design approach, involving potential users in the design process to meet their needs and expectations.
- Achieved a highly intuitive user experience and interface.

### Research Contribution
- Advanced both academic and practical knowledge by exploring the impact of blockchain technology on traditional sectors.
- Provided a case study of blockchain implementation in the wine industry.

### Technical Proficiency
- Set a standard for future projects by effectively using modern development tools and technologies such as:
  - **React.js** for the frontend framework.
  - **useEffect** for state management.
  - **web3** for smart contract and Metamask integration.
  - **Axios** for API integration.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React.js
- **State Management:** useEffect
- **Blockchain Integration:** web3, Metamask
- **API Integration:** Axios
- **Candlestick charts visualisation:** ApexCharts
